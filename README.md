# Project 5: Monster Game Program Using Classes

In this project, I focused on achieving several key learning objectives through the creation of a Monster Game program using classes. Here's what I accomplished:

## Learning Objectives

- **Working with Classes:** I gained experience working with classes, including constructors and methods, to design and implement the Monster class for the game.
- **Interpreting Existing Code:** I practiced interpreting existing code to design a new class, ensuring it met the requirements of the Monster Game program.
- **Code Modules:** I further enhanced my skills in working with code modules, organizing and modularizing my codebase effectively.
- **Executing and Debugging Node.js Code:** I honed my abilities in executing and debugging Node.js code using Visual Studio Code (VSCode), including effectively utilizing module breakpoints for debugging purposes.
- **Array Methods:** I gained more experience working with Array `map()` and `forEach()` methods, leveraging them to streamline operations on arrays of monsters.
- **Gaming Loop:** I gained experience working with the concept of a gaming loop, implementing it to control the flow of the Monster Game program.

## Overview of Project Tasks

1. **Class Creation:** I designed the `Monster` class with appropriate properties and methods, including a constructor function to initialize monster attributes and methods to manage monster life and check their status.
2. **Game Logic Implementation:** I implemented the game logic, including creating a gaming loop, generating instances of the `Monster` class, reducing monster life values, and checking for game termination conditions.
3. **Execution and Debugging:** I executed and debugged the Node.js code using VSCode, leveraging module breakpoints to identify and resolve issues effectively.
4. **Array Methods and Gaming Loop:** I utilized Array `map()` and `forEach()` methods to iterate through arrays of monsters and implemented the gaming loop to control the progression of the game.

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in working with classes, debugging Node.js applications, and implementing gaming logic using JavaScript, further enhancing my skills as a developer.
