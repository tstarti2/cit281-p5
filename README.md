# Project: Monster Game Program Using Classes

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this project, you will:

- Gain experience working with classes, including class constructors and methods.
- Gain experience interpreting existing code to design a new class, including constructor and methods.
- Gain more experience working with code modules.
- Enhance your skills in executing and debugging Node.js code using Visual Studio Code (VSCode), including module breakpoints.
- Gain more experience working with Array `map()` and `forEach()` methods.
- Gain experience working with the concept of a gaming loop.
- Gain more experience working with objects and arrays.

## Overview

In this project, you will create a Monster Game program using classes. The game will generate monsters with initial life values and minimum life values for the monsters to stay alive. During gameplay, each monster's life will gradually decrease by a random amount, and the game will continue until all monsters have died. The game will introduce a delay before each life drain.

### Project Tasks:

1. **Class Creation:**
   - Design a `Monster` class with appropriate properties and methods to represent individual monsters in the game.
   - Implement a constructor function to initialize each monster's life value and minimum life threshold.
   - Define methods to simulate life draining and check if a monster is alive.

2. **Game Logic Implementation:**
   - Create a gaming loop to control the flow of the game.
   - Generate multiple instances of the `Monster` class to populate the game environment.
   - Implement logic to gradually reduce each monster's life value by a random amount in each game iteration.
   - Check if any monsters have died and end the game when all monsters are deceased.

3. **Execution and Debugging:**
   - Execute and debug the Node.js code using Visual Studio Code (VSCode), utilizing module breakpoints for effective debugging.

4. **Array Methods and Gaming Loop:**
   - Utilize Array `map()` and `forEach()` methods to streamline operations on arrays of monsters.
   - Implement the gaming loop to iterate through all monsters and update their life values accordingly.

Completing this project will provide you with valuable experience in working with classes, understanding existing codebases, debugging Node.js applications, and implementing gaming logic using JavaScript.
